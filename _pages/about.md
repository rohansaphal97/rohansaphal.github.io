I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
\\
I completed my undergraduate studies at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Balaraman Ravindran[https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/].
\\
\\
My research is focused primarily on Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control Theory. I particularly focus on Model based, Multi-agent and Relational reinforcement learning with applications to robotics and finance.
I have  also recently dwelved into Recommender system research.
\\
I am passionate about fundamental research and bringing it into practical applications such as recommender systems and robotics.
